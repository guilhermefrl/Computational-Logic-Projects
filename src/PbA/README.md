# Problem A &mdash; How many horse rides?

## Problem

Consider a chess board _N_ by _N_ and a knight positioned in cell _(a,b)_ (with **0 ≤ _a, b_ < _N_**). The following question arises, given a positive natural integer _k_ (i.e. _k > 0_), how many paths of length _k_ and exclusively within the limits of the board can the knight take.

The challenge is to answer this question.


## Input format

The entry for this exercise consists of a line containing the 4 integers _N_, _k_, _a_ e _b_, separated by a space.


## Output format

A line with the intege _M_ that indicates how many different rides of length _k_ are possible on the board starting from  _(a, b)_.


## Limits

* _1 ≤ N ≤ 50_
* _1 ≤ k ≤ 8_


## Input example

`4 2 0 0`


## Output example

`8`
